### Techniques used in data science
- Regression analysis
- K-Nearest-Neighbor
- K-means clustering
- Logistics regression
- Principal Component Analysis
- Predictive Modeling
- Linear discriminant analysis
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision trees and random forests
- Quadratic discriminant analysis 
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Hierarchical clustering

### Types of problems
- **Classification Problems**: data is classified into various categories 
- **Function approximation**: estimating an unknown function using historical data

### Data Imputation problem
Data imputation is a method for retaining the majority of the dataset's data and information by substituting missing data with a different value

### Steps to solving any data analysis problem:
1. Define the problem in as broad way as possible
2. Classify the type of problem
3. Make assumptions related to the data (data is deterministic, variables are not related to each other, etc)
4. Identify relationships using null space
5. Actualization (implementation in R or Py)
6. Assess solution and reevaluate assumptions 
7. if solution is not realised, go back to step 3
