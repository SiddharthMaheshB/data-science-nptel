An optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function
It is the use of specific methods to determine the "best" solution to a problem (finding best functional representation fort data, finding best hyperplane to classify data)

### Components of an optimization problem
- **Objective Function**: Function to find min/max value of
- **Decision Variables**: variables that are the main thingy of the function (x in f(x))
- **Constraints**: constraints to which decision variables are bound

### Types of optimization problems
optimization problems are categorized based on type of objective function, constraints, and decision variables
- **Linear Programming Problem**: problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear function
- **Non-Linear Programming Problem**: problem of maximizing or minimizing a non-linear function
- **Integer programming problem (linear and non linear)**: where the decision variables are constrained to integers
- **mixed integer programming problem**: where some of the decision variables are constrained to integers

**Conditions for $x*$ to be minimum value of f(x)**:
- $f'(x*)=0$ 
- $f''(x*)>0$
