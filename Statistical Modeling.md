**Deterministic Phenomenon** are those whose outcomes can be predicted with a very high confidence (age of a person)
**Stochastic phenomenon** can have many possible outcomes for the same experimental conditions. (outcome of a toin coss)

There are two types of random phenomena: 
	**Discrete**: where the outcomes are finite
	**Continuous**: where the outcomes are infinite

**Independent events** are the events where the occurrence of one has no influence on the occurence of other. (Coin toss experiment)
**Mutually Exclusive Events** are the events where the occurrence of one implies the other event does not occur

### Conditional Probability 
- the probability of an event B occurring after an event A has occurred is denoted by $$P(B|A) = P(A\cap B)/P(A)$$
- Example: event A: First toss is head
	event B: Two successive heads = {HH}
	P(B) = 0.25 (no information)
	But given that event A has occurred, P(B|A) = 0.25/0.5 = 0.5

### Random Variables
- Random Variable is a variable that changes based on the outcome of the event
- for a discrete random variable the probability mass function assigns a probability to every outcome in sample space
